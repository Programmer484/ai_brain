It’s the most important component of your Earthshot. Send a message in your Earthshot channel to Max and Mikaela highlighting WHO you’ve spoken to / validated your problem with. What unique insights have you gotten from those conversations? Be specific. At this point in the Earthshot Challenge, you need to have a handle on inside information.\n- **Deliverable 1.1: Update us on validation**\nSend a message in your Earthshot team channel on Slack with the above information.\n⭐️ **Step 2:** Choose one of your top root causes from above and create a a \"Future Vision Statement\". The intention is to articulate a clear, inspiring, and realistic picture of what the future could look like if your proposed solution is successfully implemented and widely adopted.\n- **Deliverable 1.2: Future Vision Statement (5 Slide Deck)**\nA future vision statement clarifies the long-term goals and objectives of a proposed solution. This clarity helps guide decision-making and action, as well as helps stakeholders stay focused on the end goal. Create 5 slides outlining the following:\n1.

Some of them were so excited about the opportunity to get to help actually build the car they would be driving, that they became ambassadors, encouraging others to buy these cars! Teachers trust other teachers, so this was marketing gold. If we had failed to make contact early, our team probably would have built a super slick sports car, that looked great on paper, but was the complete opposite of what our potential users wanted, would use, and would pay for."}

Early in TKS, he was complaining that he didn't have enough time for his Focus. So we pushed on what was taking his time and learned he was spending a ton of time on piano and **he didn't enjoy it at all**. When we asked him why he spends so much time on piano he said, \"my parents want me to.\" We asked why his parents wanted him to and he said, \"so I can get my piano certificate.\" And so we asked again, why do they want you to get a piano certificate? And he said, \"so that my worse-case backup plan can be to make money by teaching piano.\" WHAT?! That's crazy to me! ***It doesn't make sense.*** If you want to make a big impact and do something valuable with your life, **you can't spend your time** **doing things you don't enjoy and that don't invest in your future self.** You are all in TKS, which means you have unique guidance and a powerful network to help you grow. It would be foolish not to maximize this opportunity. But don't just focus on the bigger things, make sure you also think about the small things you do that don't make sense. Do you show appreciation to your parents? Do you thank your teachers when they've put in a ton of work to help you with something? Do you make fun of your friends as a joke when deep down you know they're kinda hurt by it? Do you randomly pull out your phone for no reason, unlock it, then put it back in your pocket?

That should be 90%, and that's actually what is going to get me to, to get those, the greater wants, because I need to be able to be consistent in making progress if I'm able, if I want to enable myself to have like amazing experiences.  Ryan Leong Once again, like constant learning. I love learning. I love learning about like different things like brain computer interfaces, human psychology, how do I, like, how do we change people? How do, how does like just I love learning.  Ryan Leong On  Ryan Leong Obviously, like,  Ryan Leong I think mental health definitely. Like I think the big thing is I want to see. Motivated people. Like I wanna, I guess like really for me it's I wanna live with ambitious motivated people who want to change the world, but also I want to Like be able to Make that more of a reality. Like, I just think I just don't think it's enough. Yeah, I don't want to be like, oh, this is the people I hang out with. I wanna be like, yo, you are not necessarily like ambitious to start with, but what if when I meet you, I can change your life. I can let you, I think like I, I think I've talked about this where it would be a superpower to be able to chase someone's life positively. Like, just from one meeting. I wanna have that ability. I think that would be really nice,. So there, there's a bunch of wants I have. And Like the exact timeline doesn't really matter. But I want to have those experiences and I have to be in a position to have those experiences. Now, let's talk about like shorter term, right? So starting after this next week, we Let me think. So really what the short term, the 6 month goal, honestly probably could do this faster, right? Faster is get into that environment of like founders, people who have that same mindset changed the world, you know, build things, make things happen. And So, what would the idea be like, right? The ideal is I meet some people, hopefully a girlfriend, that'd be nice, but really just like close friends who I can really trust. And so first I'd be in the environment with similar people. Then I just like pick out a few who are who are like super, I get super close with them, right? And then we can like, I can fully rely on them. They're, they're not gonna ghost me or anything, you know, and We're also in person. We see each other like it's easy to meet meet up. That's pretty important. Then from there, it's"}

And the other thing, there will be other projects I think that I will become interested in, especially anything to do with automation. Like, what about a pickle ball pot? Like, bro, that would be so cool, like a robot, like a pickleball robot, like, something like that., so there's just lots of little things. And you know, maybe I want to like get really good at a game, like, honestly, I love video games and board games. Like, yes, I don't think their priority right now, but if I realize like later in my life that, hey, I have some time, I can actually, you know, spend on this, then I, I might just like play with some friends, some time, play a game, do some theory crafting, just, just do like, do me, you know, like, do human stuff and something that, you know, might not change the world, but it's, it's so fulfilling in its own way., What else do I really want to do.\n[](https://ca.slack-edge.com/TCKE4QSG5-U05Q9AN4VL6-04e07551535f-48)\n**Ryan Leong**\nI\n[](https://ca.slack-edge.com/TCKE4QSG5-U05Q9AN4VL6-04e07551535f-48)\n**Ryan Leong**\nYeah, so this can be these close friends,. Like, no, it has to be in person. It's just not. Yeah, I guess if I did calls with them every day for like a few hours, that would actually be pretty good. just like work calls. But what, why do I want friends in person? Well, honestly, it's not, it's not even that much about like Yeah, actually what I imagine a lot of what I would do is I would just chat, and I would like play games with them, and Maybe go places, travel and stuff. Imagine not thinking too much in terms of like co-founders. I don't think that's really the biggest thing. Like I think I love having conversations. I love being able to do things with others, and So actually, that's kind of what I see myself doing with my friends. Just having experiences with them. That's why in person is like way better.. But then again, like, OK, so how do I get there, right? So with the sales agents, let's see. Now, technically I had to make a few assumptions, but let's be real. There's a need, and if we'll find that we know there's a need, and we'll be able, we'll find a way to market, OK. So The way it works is The exact timeline. I'm gonna say. Maximum of 6 months, I think in 6 months we can make something happen. We'll get I don't honestly, I don't care about exact values, but what I'll do is I'll guarantee that. I will apply to a bunch of grants. I applied to a bunch of fellowships, and I work like full time on salmatics on our startup, our sales agents, and in the meantime, I'm enjoying it. I love building agents. I love learning about automation. I meet cool people, you know, and that's really like really fun on its own, and that's super important. But then at the same time, whatever through the actions I'm taking, we mainly applying to grant stuff, getting money and building our startup. We get, we get our first customer, basically. Probably my mom, but yeah, we get our first few customers just by like word of mouth. I'll, I'll know a lot of people who might buy it, and that's like Maybe like 100 or something, but then what we can do is we can build some AI marketing stuff, we can Figure out like good ways to market and so once we have that product, like, We will find a way, we will find a way to reach, like, let's say 1000 users, $20 per month from 1000 people, that's 20,000, so you split it and obviously I guess there's some running costs, but I, I wouldn't, I don't think it's that consequential. It's just servers, it's all sas, so. $10,000 a month is Let's see. It's not, it's not a time. Well,, Well, actually it is, it is a ton, that's $120,000 a year, damn it. OK, so that that's enough to basically live in like a quite a quite a few places. And you know what, we just scale that up, so, but at that point, the money won't be a problem. I'll be able to move wherever to Baa San Francisco. I'll figure out the expenses and stuff, really not that hard. Then, then from there I can build my dream routine like I mean I can build my dream routine here, right, but I, it's not as good as it could be. So I would imagine I go to like a bunch of founder meetups all the time. There's like Founder Hangouts, you know, We just to build stuff, play games, hackathons, lots of friends and wherever I'll make lots of friends in the cities that I'm in, whichever cities I go to. Maybe I'll travel a time if I like that, and We still work on a startup, make it big. At that point, it's like I can travel a ton. I should be able to travel any day, anywhere, anytime. Just have that money, right? So then it's like, OK, well, now we've got a bunch of money. And so now it's like money, I could. We should get to the point where we're basically I get enough so I can invest, and I, I know I can make really good investment decisions, cause I, I'm in the AI field. So I'll just like figure it out. I'll figure out how to make those good investment decisions, so I get that passive income. So I basically don't have to worry much about income anymore. And so from there, that's, I imagine that would take Anywhere from 6 months to a year, right? And so this is like really really dream territory. I mean, like I think the point is like the biggest point I'm trying to make throughout all of this is I want to be enjoying every moment and enjoying what I have in every moment. Some imagine like this is good life, good life. And so then it's like, where is the world's happiness come in? That's interesting cause I, I don't think it's maybe as important as it was initially putting it, but I do believe that I think It will bring me happiness., So I think what I do is on the side while I'm working on the sales agent, I work with the people I'm friends with, and I kind of like, you're kind of like guinea pigs, you know, it's like, OK, you want to improve, like, OK, let me talk to you. Let's, let's work on, let's see. I basically run a bunch of theories and I'm super intentional. I track everything, I take the data, and I see what works, what doesn't, and I also do reach out to people. So I think there's kind of supernatural paths here., one of them is sales agent or I guess technically we exchange ideas, but I'm going to assume it's sell. It doesn't really matter exactly what it is, it matters that we make money. And the other path is potentially like something more impact-based, and now the only concern with impact-driven things is that like, can they make money, can they scale well? Now, if we look at like Barry AI for example, yeah, plus like I'm thinking of mental health, AI, that that is a solution. They could definitely scale and it would definitely make money. You just have to market it correctly. So", "bm25_text": "5 years Ryan Leong It's kind of interesting cause I, I don't see like an immediate Need for, well, it was actually kind of weird.

What do those humanoid robots want to make the pickleball bots, the sports bots, the game agents for board games, video games, and I wanna probably like mess around with like personal automation as well throughout the entire time like just automating little things, voice agents, computer agents, that that's one part of the automation. Then, then there's like mental health and it's like, well, OK, let's, I think education's huge. I think societal change is here.

I track it all down, right, that's my knowledge so important.

Social media is not doing well for our attention, not doing well for our mental health. Ultra processed foods not working, so The causes are known. So it's really like, OK, what sort of intervention can we do that Basically Like you have to play a game against the corporation, not necessarily against. You might be able to, but I just have to be crazy, like I have to be like, yo, I'm gonna talk to the freaking owner of like McDonald's and be like, hey, like, Yeah, I know you, you get a lot of time a lot of business from this, but what if I told you like you could make a bigger impact by making it more healthy, like just try it and get rejected, like who cares? It's like, OK, let's try again, let's try a different way. Let's see what we can do until we make it work, and that's just gonna be one thing, like I'll probably want a team, a whole bunch of people and organization, and so that way I don't have to dedicate all my time, but I can like stick my nose in whenever I want. I would do that for like every single project, like, and then so I'm interested, whatever I'm interested in, I'll just stick my nose in there, I'll work on it. Work with people, work on stuff, do technical when I want, be a project manager at other times, be a connector at other times, just go exploring on my own at other times. It's really just like throughout my life. You know, those 10 years, because we're gonna assume the world ends after that,. You're just like talking to people, all different people I spent time, I don't have to be like with the same people all the time, but the key is that I'm really close with the people I am with, but at any given time, you know. That, that just feels so amazing., He's like side note in in preparation for an apocalypse, like nuclear war, it's, then it's just, it's really just about making the best I can and just Living life is a game. Life is an opportunity. Like, I'm gonna take risks because there's a, if there's a nuclear war, like, I mean, I, I sure as hell hope I don't get nuclear poisoning, but the radiation poisoning, but it's like if I would need to go somewhere to have a chance at a better life, and I have to go through like a war zone, like, bro, I'm probably gonna do that unless I think it's going to end sometime soon. Like, I'm not gonna stay in a bunker for the rest of, is not cool. So you can take risks because I know the sort of life I want to live, but,, mean that Yeah. So that's 10 years, that's only 10 years. Like I literally don't think I need. Maybe I guess 20 years maybe. So it's like if nothing if nothing crazy happens, and that's what I'll be doing. But if something crazy happens after 10 years cause of AI then You know, it's just, it's just more like, depends on where it goes, like bad scenario, then I, like I said, I'm gonna try and enjoy what I have. I really enjoy what I have, and I will take risks to try and get a better situation. If if we go into utopia scenario, it's There will be less of an impact, but there will be less of like an impact-driven stance, but it'll be like, have those experiences with friends, hang out,, have fun, build things that for myself, that probably AI could do already, so, you know, get AI to build it, but also like just Just find whatever like satiates me, right? So if it's just getting good at board games, it's like, he he has like doing everything right then sure, get good at board games, you know, or like go explore space, cause like that's, that's always gonna be unexplored. So like maybe I want to become an astronaut and I get AI to be like, hey, like suit me up, get me ready in health and shape. Let me do things that, you know, I mean, I want to go to space, like I just don't want to get radiation poisoning, so like it would be really cool. I think that's an interesting experience, right?, honestly, I don't think it will change you as much as like", "bm25_text": "5 years Ryan Leong So yeah, when it comes to worlds happy, because I think really it just If I decide that's a challenge I want to take, then it's like, let's learn about the way, more about the world, the way it works.

For three days ( July 28–30 ), before any deep work: 2 minutes nasal breathing + 5 minutes brisk movement + bright light. Journal: “What problem now feels 20% simpler?” If the answer shifts, your lever is physiology, not raw “thoughts.” Environment rewrite. On  July 29 , redesign one cue loop: place a printed 1‑line intention at the spot you usually drift (desk, bed, kitchen), add friction to the default (website blocker, phone in another room), and add a tiny “first action” within reach. Track compliance for 72 hours. Adversarial interview. Book a 60‑minute call by  August 1  with someone sharp and unsentimental. Give them this brief: “Probe for harm and self-deception in my real estate, recording, and AI projects. Push until I state explicit tradeoffs.” Record takeaways and one policy change. Pre‑mortem + red team. Write a one‑page pre‑mortem: “It’s  December 31, 2025  and my ‘world happiness’ effort stalled. Here’s exactly why.” Share with two peers; require written counters."}

What I love about PG is that he is able to derive highly valuable insights from his experiences, then structure them into well-written articles - \"PG Essays\". During the break, you're going to binge these essays. I wish I had these to read when I was in high school. So much knowledge 🧠. Read these 📖: What You'll Wish You'd Known Life is Short How to think for yourself The Anatomy of Determination Theory of Genius The Lesson to Unlearn Before the Startup What You Can't Say Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule For those of you interested in startups, read these: A Student's Guide to Startups How to Start a Startup The Hardest Lessons For Startups to Learn Ideas For Startups Jessica Livingston Jessica started Y Combinator with her husband, Paul Graham. She has seen companies grow from 0 to billions as well, and she is one of the early investors in OpenAI.  Jessica is a huge role model and advocate for female founders. She wrote a book called  Founders at Work  where she interviewed successful Founders and creators. She also organizes YC's popular  Startup School . If you want to learn more about Jessica at a deeper level, Paul Graham wrote an essay about her, you can read it here →  PG's essay on Jessica."}

They were then given opportunities to donate their money to a food bank. Donations were either voluntary or involuntary, so scientists could see the difference between giving willingly or being forced to give. When participants gave willingly, there were higher amounts of dopamine in the part of the brain associated with processing unexpected rewards. This activation could explain why people continue to give even when it costs them something.\n2 - Many factors contribute to good health. Helping others may play a role, too. A [research team](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9280.14461) from the University of British Columbia gave money to a group of people with high blood pressure.

In a [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6267087_Neural_Responses_to_Taxation_and_Voluntary_Giving_Reveal_Motives_for_Charitable_Donations) from 2007, a team of researchers gave $100 to participants and put them in an fMRI scanner. They were then given opportunities to donate their money to a food bank. Donations were either voluntary or involuntary, so scientists could see the difference between giving willingly or being forced to give. When participants gave willingly, there were higher amounts of dopamine in the part of the brain associated with processing unexpected rewards. This activation could explain why people continue to give even when it costs them something.\n2 - Many factors contribute to good health. Helping others may play a role, too. A [research team](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9280.14461) from the University of British Columbia gave money to a group of people with high blood pressure. Half of the participants were told to spend the money on themselves while the rest were told to spend it on someone else. A few weeks later, the people who had spent money on others had significantly lower blood pressure than those who spent the money on themselves.\n3 - Humans have always searched for the meaning of life.

In a [preliminary study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2015.1048814?journalCode=rpos20&) from The Journal of Positive Psychology, researchers asked 400 participants how often they engaged in altruistic behaviors and how meaningful their life felt.

Navid + Nadeem\nThere's a lot of value in getting things out into the world. One thing that Nadeem always asks himself is \"*how can I get the world to work for me?*\" For example, he might send a ton of emails early in the morning so throughout the day people can respond. But if he took too much time on writing the email and sent it out in the afternoon, he might have to wait until the next day to get a response.

On Aug 1, 2016 I started the first program of TKS. Yup, in 2 months we built the first program, got students, and changed their lives - I still get emails from the Calgary alumni! If I spent a year building the curriculum, hiring people, raising money, blah blah... then I wouldn't have launched so quickly and learned. The program improved exponentially, because in the first year we ran variations of TKS in Calgary, San Francisco, and Toronto - yup, 3 cities in one year. But the program was different than it is now, and me and Nadeem were the only directors (and only employees). We've always had a mindset of Done > Perfect, because there is no perfect. You can only get better, and the best way to get better is by getting stuff done, learning, iterating and pursuing high standards throughout the process.

There’s usually a desk and telephone in which you can telepathically talk to others or in one exercise you imagine a person (wife, friend, family member, boss etc) standing in front of you and you can take their head off and put it on yours to listen to their thoughts or maybe suggest something to them. Something like that. There are also techniques psychic healing at a distance, diagnosing people’s physical ailments psychically, changing another person’s mood by quickly entering the Silva state (with a trigger device such as making a circle with index finger and thumb, or pulling on your right earlobe or something). The trigger is what points to it being self-hypnosis."}

Fill in the template below to understand at a high level the different players and limitations for each respective solution.\n- **Deliverable 1.2: Current Solution Categorization**\nSolutions to BIG problems can usually be categorized into different “buckets”. Based on the current solutions that exist for your problem, identify three “buckets” and research the top three companies working in this space. The “Main imitation” section is specifically for the general solution bucket. You should describe why this problem exists despite this solution being invented.\n<aside>\n1️⃣ **Title Bucket #1:** with 1-2 line explanation"}

Originally I told myself this was something I’d do anyways so it didn’t matter when I went and finished the game, which is partially true since it was partway played, but afterward there was no point in continuing to look at game pieces and stuff. I remember I was (somewhat) intentional when I asked myself whether I should continue the game but the main issue was afterward The best way to deal with this is cutting down on the recreation. E.g. if my Dad offers to play Spirit Island with me it’ll be a no until I get my chess NN up and running.

Through the open gateway, he saw many fine possessions and important visitors. \"How powerful that merchant must be!\" thought the stone cutter. He became very envious and wished that he could be like the merchant.\nTo his great surprise, he suddenly became the merchant, enjoying more luxuries and power than he had ever imagined, but envied and detested by those less wealthy than himself. Soon a high official passed by, carried in a sedan chair, accompanied by attendants and escorted by soldiers beating gongs. Everyone, no matter how wealthy, had to bow low before the procession. \"How powerful that official is!\" he thought. \"I wish that I could be a high official!\"\nThen he became the high official, carried everywhere in his embroidered sedan chair, feared and hated by the people all around. It was a hot summer day, so the official felt very uncomfortable in the sticky sedan chair. He looked up at the sun.

One day he passed a wealthy merchant's house. Through the open gateway, he saw many fine possessions and important visitors. \"How powerful that merchant must be!\" thought the stone cutter. He became very envious and wished that he could be like the merchant. To his great surprise, he suddenly became the merchant, enjoying more luxuries and power than he had ever imagined, but envied and detested by those less wealthy than himself. Soon a high official passed by, carried in a sedan chair, accompanied by attendants and escorted by soldiers beating gongs. Everyone, no matter how wealthy, had to bow low before the procession. \"How powerful that official is!\" he thought. \"I wish that I could be a high official!\" Then he became the high official, carried everywhere in his embroidered sedan chair, feared and hated by the people all around. It was a hot summer day, so the official felt very uncomfortable in the sticky sedan chair. He looked up at the sun. It shone proudly in the sky, unaffected by his presence. \"How powerful the sun is!\" he thought. \"I wish that I could be the sun!\" Then he became the sun, shining fiercely down on everyone, scorching the fields, cursed by the farmers and laborers.
